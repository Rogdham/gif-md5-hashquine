What is a hashquine?
--------------------

“Hashquine” is a term coined by
[foone](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/839213095901765632)
meaning “file that show their own hash”.


Wait, I thought someone made one before
---------------------------------------

Indeed! [spq](https://twitter.com/__spq__/status/838583044260904960)
created a GIF MD5 hashquine before, but I did not know at that time.


How did you do it?
------------------

Stay tuned for the write up!


Could you release the source code? I want to generate my own
------------------------------------------------------------

Definitively, hold still!
